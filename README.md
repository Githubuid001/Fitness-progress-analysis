This project will track various health and fitness metrics
On a regular basis, I will record various activities like running or other cardio specific workouts as well as weightlifing activities as well as physical attributes like weight, blood pressure and resting pulse.  The goal is to improve fitness and ability to execute olympic lifts and power lifts over time.
